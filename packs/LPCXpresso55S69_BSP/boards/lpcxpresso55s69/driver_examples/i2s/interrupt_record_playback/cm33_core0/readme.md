Overview
========

The I2S example project uses one I2S interface to continuously record input sound to a buffer
and another I2S interface to playback the buffer to output - digital loopback.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- Keil MDK  5.38.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55s69 board
- Personal Computer
- headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack
- source of sound (line output to 3.5 mm stereo jack)


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect headphones to Audio HP / Line-Out connector.
2.  Connect source of sound(from PC or Smart phone) to Audio Line-In connector.
3.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (P6) on the board
4.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings :
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
5.  Download the program to the target board.
6.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
