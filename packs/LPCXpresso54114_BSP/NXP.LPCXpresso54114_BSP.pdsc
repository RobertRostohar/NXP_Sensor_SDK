      <description>The multicore Low Power demo application demonstrates how to leverage the auxiliary core for periodicdata collection from sensors and passing the data to the primary core for further processing.The data from sensors is read with frequency of about 50Hz (every 20ms) by secondary core and storedinto a buffer. When the buffer contains 50 samples from sensors, the secondary core sends an interruptto the primary core to process the data. The primary core computes average values from temperature andpressure and then prints them with last values from other sensors to the console.The reading of data from sensors takes about 3ms, the rest of the time the cores are in deep sleepmode to reduce power consumption. In order to switch to deep sleep mode, the Power APIPOWER_EnterDeepSleep() is used and to wake it up the interrupt from uTick timer is used.When both cores can't go to the deep sleep mode (the primary core processes data or the secondary corereads data from the sensors), the core which has nothing to do goes to sleep mode by WFI. Also, whenthe primary core is switched to the sleep mode, the flash memory is powered down by Power APIPOWER_PowerDownFlash() and before waking up the primary core it is powered on by POWER_PowerUpFlash().The demo is based on:A.

      <description>The multicore Low Power demo application demonstrates how to leverage the auxiliary core for periodicdata collection from sensors and passing the data to the primary core for further processing.The data from sensors is read with frequency of about 50Hz (every 20ms) by secondary core and storedinto a buffer. When the buffer contains 50 samples from sensors, the secondary core sends an interruptto the primary core to process the data. The primary core computes average values from temperature andpressure and then prints them with last values from other sensors to the console.The reading of data from sensors takes about 3ms, the rest of the time the cores are in deep sleepmode to reduce power consumption. In order to switch to deep sleep mode, the Power APIPOWER_EnterDeepSleep() is used and to wake it up the interrupt from uTick timer is used.When both cores can't go to the deep sleep mode (the primary core processes data or the secondary corereads data from the sensors), the core which has nothing to do goes to sleep mode by WFI. Also, whenthe primary core is switched to the sleep mode, the flash memory is powered down by Power APIPOWER_PowerDownFlash() and before waking up the primary core it is powered on by POWER_PowerUpFlash().The demo is based on:A.

      <description>The lpc_adc_basic example shows how to use LPC ADC driver in the simplest way.In this example, the internal temperature sensor is used to created the input analog signal. When user type in any key from the keyboard, the software trigger API is called to start the conversion. Then it polls the conversion sequence A's flag till the conversion is completed. When the conversion is completed, just print the conversion result to terminal.Project Information1.what are ADC conversion sequences?  A conversion sequence is a single pass through a series of A/D conversions performed on a selected set of  A/D channels. Software can set-up two independent conversion sequences, either of which can be triggered   by software or by a transition on one of the hardware triggers. Each sequence can be triggered by a different   hardware trigger. One of these conversion sequences is referred to as the A sequence and the other as the B  sequence. It is not necessary to employ both sequences. An optional single-step mode allows advancing through  the channels of a sequence one at a time on each successive occurrence of a trigger. The user can select whether  a trigger on the B sequence can interrupt an already-in-progress A sequence. The B sequence, however, can never be  interrupted by an A trigger.  2. How to use software-triggered conversion?   There are two ways that software can trigger a conversion sequence:      1. Start Bit: The first way to software-trigger an sequence is by setting the START bit in         the corresponding SEQn_CTRL register. The response to this is identical to         occurrence of a hardware trigger on that sequence. Specifically, one cycle of         conversions through that conversion sequence will be immediately triggered except         as indicated above. (In this example, we use this way.)      2.

      <description>The lpc_adc_burst example shows how to use LPC ADC driver with the burst mode.In this example, the internal temperature sensor is used to created the input analog signal.When user type in any key from the keyboard, the burst mode is enabled. Then the conversion sequence A would be started automatically, till the burst would be disabled in conversion completed ISR. Project Information1.what are ADC conversion sequences?  A conversion sequence is a single pass through a series of A/D conversions performed on a selected set of  A/D channels. Software can set-up two independent conversion sequences, either of which can be triggered   by software or by a transition on one of the hardware triggers. Each sequence can be triggered by a different   hardware trigger. One of these conversion sequences is referred to as the A sequence and the other as the B  sequence. It is not necessary to employ both sequences. An optional single-step mode allows advancing through  the channels of a sequence one at a time on each successive occurrence of a trigger. The user can select whether  a trigger on the B sequence can interrupt an already-in-progress A sequence. The B sequence, however, can never be  interrupted by an A trigger.  2. How to use software-triggered conversion?   There are two ways that software can trigger a conversion sequence:      1. Start Bit: The first way to software-trigger an sequence is by setting the START bit in         the corresponding SEQn_CTRL register. The response to this is identical to         occurrence of a hardware trigger on that sequence. Specifically, one cycle of         conversions through that conversion sequence will be immediately triggered except         as indicated above.       2. Burst Mode: The other way to initiate conversions is to set the BURST bit in the         SEQn_CTRL register. As long as this bit is 1 the designated conversion sequence will         be continuously and repetitively cycled through. Any new software or hardware trigger         on this sequence will be ignored. (In this example, we use this way.)         3. What kinds of interrupt do ADC have?   There are four interrupts that can be generated by the ADC:     â€¢ Conversion-Complete or Sequence-Complete interrupts for sequences A and B     â€¢ Threshold-Compare Out-of-Range Interrupt     â€¢ Data Overrun Interrupt   Any of these interrupt requests may be individually enabled or disabled in the INTEN register.  Program Flow1.This example demonstrates how to configure the A sequences with burst mode, you can configure channel via   "DEMO_ADC_SAMPLE_CHANNEL_NUMBER".  2.Before configuration of the ADC begins, the ADC is put through a self-calibration cycle.  3.Enable the Conversion-Complete or Sequence-Complete interrupt for sequences A.  4.After ADC channels are assigned to each of the sequences, if the user enters any key via terminal, burst mode will start.    5.When the first conversion completes, the interrupt would be triggered. The ISR will stop the burst mode and print conversion result   to terminal.</description>

      <description>The lpc_adc_dma example shows how to use LPC ADC driver with DMA.In this example, the internal temperature sensor is used to created the input analog signal. When user type in any key from the keyboard, the software trigger API is called to start the conversion. When the ADC conversion is completed, it would trigger the DMA to move the ADC conversion result from ADC conversion data register to user indicated memory. Then the main loop waits for the transfer to be done and print the result to terminal.Project Information1.what are ADC conversion sequences?

The sequence-A or sequence-B conversion/sequence-complete interrupts may also be   used to generate a DMA trigger. To trigger a DMA transfer, the same conditions must be   met as the conditions for generating an interrupt.   Remark: If the DMA is used, the ADC interrupt must be disabled in the NVIC.   Program Flow1.This example demonstrates how to configure the A sequences with interrupt, assigning one channel with software  trigger, you can configure channel via "DEMO_ADC_SAMPLE_CHANNEL_NUMBER".  2.Before configuration of the ADC begins, the ADC is put through a self-calibration cycle.  3.Configure the DMA and DMAMUX to work with ADC sequences.4.Enable the Conversion-Complete or Sequence-Complete DMA for sequences A.  5.After ADC channels are assigned to each of the sequences, if the user enters any key via terminal, software trigger will start.    6.When the conversion completes, the DMA would be requested.7.When the DMA transfer completes, DMA will trigger a interrupt.

      <description>The power_manager_lpc application shows the usage of normal power mode control APIs for entering the three kinds of low power mode: Sleep mode, Deep Sleep mode and Sleep Power Down mode. When the application runs to each low power mode, the device would cut off the power for specific modules to save energy. The device can be also waken up by prepared wakeup source from external event.
Tips: This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste some energy. - Other low power consideration based on the actual application hardware. - In order to meet typedef power consumption of DateSheet manual, Please configure MCU under the following conditions. éˆ¥?Configure all pins as GPIO with pull-up resistor disabled in the IOCON block. éˆ¥?Configure GPIO pins as outputs using the GPIO DIR register. éˆ¥?Write 1 to the GPIO CLR register to drive the outputs LOW. éˆ¥?All peripherals disabled.</description>

The first half of the transmission will receive data, and the second half will senddata back to master, so the address of the receive buffer is &amp;rxDataPolling[64].In this example, one spi instance as slave and another spi instance on the other board as master. Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from master is correct. And slave will print what it received.</description>

      <description>This example shows how to use the DMA driver to implement a double buffer receive scheme from the USARTThe example shows the double buffer constructed using two descriptors (g_pingpong_desc). These descriptors are cycled from one to the other.Things to note- The descriptors of the ping pong transfer need to be aligned to size 16- The inital transfer will perform the same job as first descriptor of ping pong, so the first linkeage is to go to g_pingpong_desc[1]- g_pingpong_desc[1] then chains the g_pingpong_desc[0] as the next descriptor- The properties are set up such that g_pingpong_desc[0] (and the initial configuration uses INTA to signal back to the callback)- g_pingpong_desc[1] uses INTB to signal to the callback- The scheduled callback uses this information to know which data was last writtenA note on PerformanceThe intent of this example is to illustrate how a double-buffer scheme can be implemented using the dma. The performance of this example will be limited to how quickly the echo printer can read-out the data from the ping pong buffer and display it. This means that the example will work well if characters are entered at a rate where the DMA callback to echo the string can keep up with the input stream. Connecting the USARTRX to a continuous fast speed will cause the DMA to fall behind. </description>
